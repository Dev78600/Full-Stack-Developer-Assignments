Promises provide a cleaner and more robust way of handling asynchronous operations compared to callbacks.
They help avoid the “callback hell” or “pyramid of doom” by allowing asynchronous functions to return values like synchronous functions: then() for success, catch() for errors.
Promises support better error handling and make the code more readable and maintainable.
