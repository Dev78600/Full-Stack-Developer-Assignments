The XMLHttpRequest object is a core feature of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) that allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it’s possible to update parts of a web page without reloading the whole page.

Here’s a brief explanation:

Definition: It’s a JavaScript object that provides methods to send and receive data from a server.
Usage in AJAX: It’s used to make HTTP requests to the server after the initial page load, retrieve data, and then update the web page dynamically based on the server’s response.
This object can handle data in various formats, including XML, JSON, and plain text, making it versatile for different web applications.
